COSC 2336.S70
PROGRAM THREE

ASSIGNMENT:

Create a program, which will perform the following actions:

1.	Create a class to control manipulation (input and output) of a random access file 
		containing of set of text strings of varying length with the following format:
	a)	At the beginning will be a 32-bit integer having the number of strings in the file.
	b)	At the end will be an array of pairs of 32-bit integers 
		(corresponding to the offset from the beginning of the file 
		to the start of the corresponding string and the length of the string in bytes).
	c)	The number at the beginning will be followed by a set of strings of text. 
		There is no special termination character at the end of a string.
2.	The class will support methods with the following capabilities:
	a)	Get will have one 32-bit integer parameter (the index of the string to retrieve) 
		and one string parameter to be filled in with the string read.
	b)	Replace will have one 32-bit integer parameter (the index of where the string will be written) 
		and one string parameter containing the string to write. 
		If the index to write is larger than the current largest index, 
		insert a series of zero value indices (to indicate empty strings) into the array.
	c)	Insert will have the same parameters as Replace but instead of writing over an index, 
		it will move all indices from the insert point on down by one and write the new string into the new space.
3.	Test your class by allowing the user to enter the following from the keyboard:
	a)	G followed by an integer to read and print the string at the requested index.
	b)	R followed by an integer and a string to write a string at the requested index.
	c)	I followed by an integer and a string to insert a string at the requested index.
